# dotfiles

My configeration files. Used in conjuction with stow for standing up and tracking modifications to environment

## This repo is becoming redundant
Main or imprtant componants/projects will move into their own repo and become submodules for stowing.
configs moving into thier own repo will be:
- i3wm
- nvim
- tmux
- polybar

This will allow me to simplify branching etc for sanity and for isolating out configuration for install base use case
